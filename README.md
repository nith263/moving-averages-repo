# VAS Stock Predictions: Moving Averages

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of historical stock data of the Vanguard Australian Shares ETF (VAS), traded on the Vanguard Australia Investment Management Platform. The dataset spans from the 5th of January 2011 to the 4th of April 2024 encapsulating the dynamics of the Australian market landscape. 
In addition to the raw data, the repository also contains insightful visualisations and analyses, shedding light on the intrinsic patterns and trends embedded within the stock's trajectory. By employing the computation of three simple moving averages, (50-day, 100-day, and 200-day), the repository illuminates key insights into the temporal dynamics of VAS stock. 

## Data Source
The data was obtained from the Vanguard Australia website [here](https://www.vanguard.com.au/personal/invest-with-us/etf?subAssetClass=australian&portId=8205&tab=prices-and-distributions).

## Files

**100_day_moving_average_plot.png**: Plot of the 100-day moving average and actual prices. \
**200_day_moving_average_plot.png**: Plot of the 200-day moving average and actual prices. 

## Findings
After analyzing the data and plotting the moving averages, the following key finding was observed:
- The 50-day moving average appeared to be the most effective at predicting stock performance.
- The 200-day moving average has the greatest lag in price prediction and underestimates areas where there are sudden declines.

This finding suggests that the 50-day moving average could be a useful indicator for making investment decisions related to VAS stock.
